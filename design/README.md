# Design Overview Assets

This folder contains PlantUML sources that document the architecture of the voice assistant.

- `system_flow.puml` — activity-style view covering the runtime loop from CLI start through STT/LLM/TTS interactions and memory handling.
- `c4_overview.puml` — two C4 diagrams (context and container levels) describing the assistant's ecosystem, major subsystems, and hardware/software dependencies.

Render these `.puml` files with PlantUML (or an IDE plugin) to explore the diagrams.
